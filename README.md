# An introduction to Exploits, Goldhen and PS4-Homebrew for beginners
An explanation about Goldhen, exploit compatability, PS4 downgrade conditions and other useful beginner information     
      
# What are **Exploits**              
In the context of the PS4, exploits allow you to run arbitrary/unsigned code by **exploiting** weaknesses in the system and gaining *userland* access to execute code in the console with the same permissions as an average app          
, for a full jailbreak to run Homebrew like Goldhen a kernel vulnerability is also needed.      
                  
Webkit exploits which are loaded solely through the PS4 Browser. The active ones range 5.05, to 7.55, currently have kernel access, there are some currently on higher firmwares but they do not lead to kernel access at this time(besides when being chained with the 9.00, kernel exploit below).         
                   
The 9.00, kernel exploit [**pOOBs4**](https://github.com/ChendoChap/pOOBs4) directly gains kernel access the exploit is only available for firmware 9.00, this exploit is unlike previous ones which were purely software based. Triggering the vulnerability requires plugging in a specially formatted USB device at just the right time or by using a small single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi zero or a Esp32  low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi additionally it has been chained with a WebKit Exploit [**PSfree**](https://github.com/kmeps4/PSFree) for better performance.       
     
The latest kernel exploit is called [**PPPwn**](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn).  Current supported versions by Goldhen 
9.00 9.60 10.00 10.01 and 11.00        
PPPwn is a kernel remote code execution exploit which uses a malicious [PPPoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet) server to cause denial-of-service or potentially remote code execution in kernel context on the PS4/PS5.   
This exploit is the first to cover a large range of firmware versions 7.00, to 11.00, on the PS4.        
To run the PPPwn exploit you need an external device like a Desktop Computer, Laptop,Raspberry Pi,Router,Specific Routers, Luckfox Pico, Specific LG Smart TV's, etc.       
TLDR: Exploits come before Goldhen.    
# NOTICE: No exploit is available that is persistent after a reboot   
This means that if you turn your console off you will need to run the exploit again on next boot.     
     
      
# What is [**Goldhen**](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN)    
The *hen* in Goldhen stands for *Homebrew Enabler*     
       
Homebrew Enabler allows you to install community made applications and utilities like       
      
[Homebrew Store](https://pkg-zone.com/update/Store-R2.pkg) > a homebrew-oriented store front-end which lets users download and install apps and homebrew games directly onto the PS4 where you can also download the homebrew apps mentioned bellow or visit the website PKG-Zone       
      
[Apollo Save Tool](https://pkg-zone.com/details/APOL00004) > Automatic Save-mounting (GoldHEN or ps4debug required), Offline Account activation, Save editing utility          
      
[PS4 Cheats Manager](https://pkg-zone.com/details/CHTM00777) > A Homebrew appplication that allows you to load cheats,patches and plugins for games into the Integrated Cheat Menu          
       
[Itemzflow Game Manager](https://pkg-zone.com/details/ITEM00001) > Itemzflow is a Free and Open source PS4 home menu alternative Itemzflow expands the beyond limits of Sony's ShellUI as it allows you to launch games back up games,updates, dlc etc.   
      
And install game dumps in FPKG format along with updates and dlc. (Look at Cheats guide for important information about dump version and region)    
      

This is a list of Goldhen's features

# What are PKGS and FPKGS      
In short:    
       
pkg = Official game, update or dlc file a normal pkg that checks the user who launches the app has a license to run.    
     
fpkg = dumped game with fake verification via Debug or Goldhen.
     
To note all pkg's come in the .pkg file format    
       
PKGS are retail files usually game updates found on [Orbis-Patches](https://orbispatches.com/) used to update your retail owned games digitally and physically while running Goldhen 
# Retail PKG files cannot be used on FKPGS! But FPKGS can be installed onto Retail PKGS.    

# Playing games while exploited   
To connect to PSN you need to be on the latest firmware. It does not matter if a jailbreak is active or not it will always  try to force you to update to the latest firmware.    
      
So no online gameplay is possible like GTA online no COD no Fortnite etc can be played since you cannot connect to official PSN servers. Although a homebrew app called PSLan exists that allows you to simulate LAN lobbies(only with other jailbroken consoles)       
      
# Remote Play    
On firmware versions above 7.xx to use chiaki for remote play you need to fake activate ([Activation guide](https://github.com/DrYenyen/-How-to-use-Apollo-Save-Tool-AIO-and-Fake-account-for-Chaiki-)) your ps4 user account or if already have a real psn account on the ps4 you will be able to continue as usual.
      
# Firmware required for games                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Retail and FPKG games and their updates have a minimum firmware version that they can run on although FPKGS usually have backports which means they can run on lower firmware than the retail games.    
     
	 
# Cheats and Patches 
1. Cheats and Patches can only be used when Goldhen is enabled      
2. Games HAVE to be at a certain version for cheats and patches to work       
3. Some games can have cheats and patches for multiple versions [cheats guide here](https://github.com/DrYenyen/How-To-Use-Goldhen-Cheats-and-Patches-On-PS4)          
       
# The PS4 system game structure  
1 The product code is distinct to a region, and the common codes youâ€™ll see are CUSA, PCAS, and PLAS.      
It is followed by a unique number ID.        
R1 USA-*CUSA*       
R2 Europe-*CUSA*         
R3 Asia-*PLAS*, *PCAS*    
         
For example Minecraft USA is *CUSA00744* while Minecraft EU is *CUSA00265*              
Another example Resident Evil 2, USA is *CUSA09193* while Asia is *PLAS10335*     
                
2. Game files on the PS4 are considered *Apps* by the system and are located on the HDD inside the /user/app directory in folders reflecting their product code region and unique number ID.       
            
3. Game Updates files on the PS4 are considered *Patches* by the system and are located on the HDD inside the /user/patch directory in folders reflecting their product code region and unique number ID.       
      
4. Game DLC files on the ps4 are considered *Add-on Content* by the system and are located on the HDD inside the /user/addcont directory in folders reflecting their product code region and unique number ID.   
        
5. Additionally Screenshots and Videos are in /user/av_content/    
(How to FTP into PS4 and view the contents of the HDD guide placeholder)       
      
   
# How a PS4 can be downgraded     
You can only downgrade to the direct previous firmwared you were on. So if you updated from 11.00, to 11.02, you can only go back to  11.00,   
Downgrading can be done under certain conditions           
1. You have not initialised the console on the current firmware > this will make both your previous firmware and current firmware the same version      
2. You have not reinstalled system firmware to fix Hard Drive issues > this will make both your previous firmware and current firmware the same version          
3. You have not replaced your Hard Drive and reinstalled the current system firmware > this will make both your previous firmware and current firmware the same version         
4. Your Syscon must be A0X-COLX (X=Digits on your Syscon)      
5. You have good soldering skills
